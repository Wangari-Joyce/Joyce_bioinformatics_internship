# Internship Report
## Introduction 
This is a report of my internship journey in the EANBiT Bioinformatics and Incubation and Mentorship programme at ICIPE which began on 6/10/2021 to 31/01/2022. The aim of this programme is to have well trained bioinformatcians to support genomics research The internship involves a one month rigorous training involving both technical and soft skills learning after which one is required to reproduce a scientific paper to enhance the skills learnt and also to prepare for the mini-project. The mini-project provides hands on experience and enhances knowledge and skill retention,The mini-project also involves weekly code reviews to review progress and to also be guided on the project.

## Objectives



## Training and skills learnt
1. Purpose Roadmap 
In the begining of the internship i learnt how to write a [purpose roadmap](url) to outline what i hoped to achieve to by the in the four months of internship. This kept me motivated and  focused on my goals. In retrospect, i have achieved almost everything that i had purposed to do.



3. Using Git and Github
Git is a version control system that helps keep track of history of the the things one is working on
GitHub is a web based service for version control and online collaboration.
I used Git and GitHub in creating and managing our projects, documenting codes, writing to do lists and working collaboratively in the projects.



5. Unix overview
I learnt a wide range of commands to navigate through the command line, from using simple commands to writing complex scripts in bash.
Having used bash every single day from when we were reproducing the scientific paper and in the mini-project has made it
