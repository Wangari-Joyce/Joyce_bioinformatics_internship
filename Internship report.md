# Internship Report
## Introduction 
This is a report of my internship journey in the EANBiT Bioinformatics and Incubation and Mentorship programme at ICIPE which began on 6/10/2021 to 31/01/2022. The aim of this programme is to have well trained bioinformatcians to support genomics research The internship involves a one month rigorous training involving both technical and soft skills learning after which one is required to reproduce a scientific paper to enhance the skills learnt and also to prepare for the mini-project. The mini-project provides hands on experience and enhances knowledge and skill retention,The mini-project also involves weekly code reviews to review progress and to also be guided on the project.

## Objectives



## Training and skills learnt
